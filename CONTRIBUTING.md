##How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need developers to help this project come to fruition.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and  check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

## Pay for pull
We are using a "pay for pull" model for some of the issues in this repository. For issues labelled with a “Help Wanted” AND a “$ Amount" we will pay a flat dollar amount if we merge your contribution. 

Please read the [Rapid Adoption Guide](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/rapid-adoption/wiki) for everything you need to know to participate in a Pay for Pull.

For your pull request to be considered for payment, you must include a copy of the Terms completed with your information and a PayPal email link in the comments section of the of the pull request. Please read the Pay for Pull [Terms](https://github.com/bcgov/citizen-engagement-web-toolkit/blob/master/TERMS.md). 

## Testing
We use JShint for our JavaScript testing, so you may want to use this too.  We do thorough code review and user testing on our side to make sure it meets the acceptance criteria before we merge your contribution. 

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions below and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions
When it comes to PHP coding, we are heavily into [phpDocumentor](http://phpdoc.org/) for keeping to accessible PHP coding conventations.  Looking for a quickstart, check out [phpDocumentor Quickstart](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.quickstart.pkg.html).  Lastly, we also look to [getBootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/) for examples of how to use Bootstrap components and code in JavaScript nicely.
